# polyproto
A generator based on geometric shapes to test a keras CNN. Often you want to test your CNN but you do not have any data, or the data you have is not quite fitting. With this repo you can change the width, height and amount of classes you want to differ with simple settings. Then polygons will be produced. The generators are working out of the box
